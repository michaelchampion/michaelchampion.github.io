# Cosplaying Down the Road to Hell: How Well-Meaning but Politically Naive Advocacy Made Things Worse

## The Road to Hell Is Paved With Vibes

Here's a fun fact that nobody wants to hear: being right doesn't mean you're effective. In fact, being *morally correct* while being *strategically incompetent* is one of the fastest ways to accidentally help the very forces you think you're fighting.

Welcome to the world of **cosplay activism**—where the aesthetics of resistance matter more than actual results, where purity tests replace coalition-building, and where feeling righteous is more important than reducing harm. It's politics as performance art, except the consequences are very, very real.

This isn't about people having bad intentions. It's about good intentions colliding with political naïveté, fragmentation, and a fundamental misunderstanding of how power actually works. The result? Activists and advocates who end up greasing the rails for worse outcomes while congratulating themselves on their principles.

We're going to walk through three case studies in how good intentions plus bad strategy equals spectacular own-goals:

1. **The Judean People's Front** from *Monty Python's Life of Brian*—a fictional but devastatingly accurate parable about purity politics
2. **Palestinian and Somali activists** in the US who were so angry at Biden that they helped create conditions for a Trump comeback (who was objectively worse for their communities)
3. **The W3C's noble but toothless efforts** on privacy and environmental sustainability—standards that look impressive on paper but change nothing in practice

Buckle up. This is going to be uncomfortable.

## The Judean People's Front: Purity Politics as Self-Sabotage

Let's start with fiction, because sometimes fiction tells the truth better than reality.

In *Monty Python's Life of Brian*, there's a running gag about revolutionary groups fighting Roman occupation in Judea. You've got the Judean People's Front, the People's Front of Judea, the Judean Popular People's Front, and so on. These groups spend more time hating *each other* than they spend fighting Rome. They're obsessed with ideological purity, correct terminology, and who gets to be the "real" resistance. Meanwhile, Rome just... keeps occupying Judea.

The joke is funny because it's painfully accurate. These micro-factions would rather die than cooperate with someone who has a slightly different interpretation of revolutionary theory. They mistake internal drama for external impact. They're so busy performing resistance for each other that they forget the actual goal: getting Rome out.

This is **fragmentation LARPing as integrity**.

And here's the thing: this pattern shows up *constantly* in real-world movements. People prefer purity, clout, and in-group status over building broad, messy, effective coalitions. They'd rather be the most correct person in a losing movement than compromise and actually win something.

The Judean People's Front isn't just a joke—it's a warning. When you care more about who's in your coalition than whether your coalition can actually achieve anything, you've already lost. You're just cosplaying revolution while the people with actual power laugh all the way to the bank (or the palace, or the data center).

## When Protest Becomes a Boomerang: Activism Around Biden, Trump, and Foreign Policy

Now let's talk about a real-world example that's going to make some people very angry.

In the lead-up to recent US elections, significant portions of Palestinian and Somali activist communities were—understandably—furious with the Biden administration. Gaza policy, foreign policy decisions, immigration enforcement, you name it. The anger was real, the grievances were legitimate, and the frustration was entirely justified.

But here's where strategy went out the window.

In response to this anger, some activists and community members:
- Withheld votes from Democrats
- Pushed "protest abstention" or third-party voting
- Focused on symbolic rejection of Biden rather than on the concrete stakes of what came next

The implicit logic seemed to be: "If we punish the Democrats hard enough, they'll learn their lesson and come back begging for our votes next time. Plus, how much worse could it really get?"

Spoiler alert: **It got worse.**

The moves that were supposed to "send a message" may have actually contributed to conditions that helped Trump gain strength or win—and Trump was *objectively worse* for these same communities:
- Harsher rhetoric and policy toward immigrants and Muslims
- The Muslim ban (remember that?)
- Less concern for human rights framing in foreign policy
- Empowerment of the US right wing that is *openly hostile* to Palestinian and Somali interests

This is what happens when you confuse moral clarity with strategic thinking. Two massive naïve assumptions were at play:

**Naïve Assumption #1:** "It can't actually get worse, so withdrawing support is risk-free."

Wrong. It can *always* get worse. There is no floor. Power doesn't care about your vibes, and the more authoritarian side will happily accept your gift-wrapped electoral advantage.

**Naïve Assumption #2:** "If we punish the lesser evil hard enough, they'll come back begging for our votes next time."

Also wrong. In a two-party system, when you withdraw from one coalition, you don't create leverage—you just make the other coalition stronger. And that other coalition? They're not coming to negotiate with you. They're coming to implement policies that are *even worse* for your community.

Here's the brutal truth: **You can't boycott the ballot box and then act shocked when someone else's coalition picks the government.**

Treating elections like Yelp reviews—where you can just withhold your five stars until the restaurant improves—is a luxury that vulnerable communities don't actually have. Because while you're making your symbolic point, the people who *will* be most harmed by the worse outcome are often the very communities you claim to represent.

This isn't about "voting blue no matter who" or abandoning principles. It's about understanding that in a system with two viable options, symbolic protest voting is often just a strategic gift to the worse alternative. The road to hell isn't just paved with good intentions—it's paved with people who thought their moral purity was more important than material outcomes for the most vulnerable.

## W3C: The Committee That Cried "Standard"

Let's switch gears to the tech world, where a different kind of cosplay is happening.

The **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)** is the standards body behind many of the technical specifications that make the web work. It's full of smart people with good intentions who want to make the internet better. Over the years, they've tried to tackle some genuinely important problems:

- **Privacy**: Do Not Track, various consent frameworks, tracking prevention specs
- **Environmental sustainability**: Standards and guidelines to reduce energy use and encourage "green" web practices

Sounds great, right? Finally, someone's doing something about surveillance capitalism and the internet's carbon footprint!

Except... not really.

Here's the pattern that keeps repeating:

### Grand Language, Zero Enforcement

W3C standards are full of aspirational language about privacy and sustainability. They read beautifully. They make you feel like progress is happening. But they have absolutely *zero* practical teeth. There's no enforcement mechanism. Companies can just... ignore them.

### Corporate Capture and Veto Power

The big browser vendors and ad tech firms that actually control the web can simply choose not to implement specs that threaten their business models. Google, Meta, and friends send representatives to these committees, nod along politely, and then do whatever they were going to do anyway.

### Endless Process, Minimal Outcome

Years—sometimes *decades*—of working groups, mailing lists, and technical bikeshedding result in:
- Half-implemented features that don't work across browsers
- Specs that vendors adopt in name only
- Privacy theater while surveillance capitalism keeps printing money

The W3C has become a place where:
- Technocrats can feel like they're "doing something"
- Companies can virtue signal by sending reps to "privacy" and "sustainability" committees
- The real status quo—tracking, ad-driven metrics, wasteful design—stays basically unchanged

This is **bureaucratic cosplay**. Lots of documents, RFCs, task forces, and conference presentations. Very little shift in actual power, incentives, or enforcement.

Do Not Track is the perfect example. It was supposed to be a simple signal: users could tell websites "please don't track me," and websites would respect that. Sounds reasonable! Except ad tech companies just... didn't respect it. And there was no mechanism to make them. So now Do Not Track is a zombie standard—technically still around, functionally useless.

Meanwhile, the only privacy improvements that have actually worked are the ones where browser vendors (mainly Apple and Mozilla) just *unilaterally blocked tracking technologies* without asking permission. Turns out you need power and willingness to use it, not just a nicely formatted specification document.

The sustainability efforts are even more depressing. The W3C has guidelines about energy-efficient web design, but they're completely voluntary and have no measurable impact on how the web actually gets built. Meanwhile, the real drivers of web bloat—ad tech, tracking scripts, auto-playing videos, cryptocurrency miners—continue unchecked because they're profitable.

Privacy and sustainability have become *branding exercises* instead of constraints on what powerful actors can do. The W3C provides the aesthetic of governance without the substance of power.

## Common Failure Modes: How Good Intentions Turn Into Bad Outcomes

Let's connect the dots between our three examples.

The Judean People's Front, dissatisfied activists enabling worse electoral outcomes, and the W3C's toothless standards all share the same underlying failure modes:

### 1. Symbolism Over Strategy

Looking and feeling righteous takes priority over winning concrete gains. The performance of resistance becomes more important than actual resistance. You get points for having the right aesthetic, the right language, the right enemies—but nobody's tracking whether you're actually moving the needle on material conditions.

### 2. Purity Tests Over Coalitions

Anyone not 100% aligned is treated as the enemy, even when you objectively need them to prevent a worse outcome. The Judean People's Front would rather fight other resistance groups than build a united front against Rome. Activists would rather punish imperfect allies than prevent the rise of open adversaries. Standards bodies would rather have perfect specs that nobody implements than imperfect solutions that actually work.

### 3. Process as a Substitute for Power

Committees, charters, working groups, and standards documents masquerade as "action" while the people with actual power continue doing whatever they want. The W3C is the poster child for this, but it shows up everywhere: endless meetings, frameworks, and position papers that create the *feeling* of progress without the *reality* of changed incentives.

### 4. Ignoring Incentives

People assume that moral arguments alone will sway institutions whose incentives point the other way. Ad tech companies will respect Do Not Track because it's the right thing to do! Politicians will change course because we withheld our votes! Except... no. Institutions respond to incentives, not to moral appeals. If you're not changing the incentive structure, you're not changing behavior.

### 5. Short-Term Emotional Satisfaction Over Long-Term Material Outcomes

People choose the action that feels cathartic *now*—boycotting, denouncing, burning bridges, writing the perfect specification—rather than the action that minimizes harm or builds leverage over time. Emotional satisfaction is immediate and guaranteed. Strategic patience is hard and uncertain. Guess which one wins?

These aren't just mistakes—they're self-inflicted traps. They're ways that well-meaning people accidentally become obstacles to their own goals.

## Lessons: How Not to Cosplay Your Way Down the Road to Hell

Okay, enough diagnosis. Let's talk about what actually works.

If you want to avoid accidentally helping the forces you're fighting, here are some rules of thumb that sound obvious but are constantly violated:

### Rule #1: Count Power, Not Feelings

Always ask: Who holds power? What are their incentives? How does this action shift them—even slightly?

If your answer is "this action doesn't shift power, but it makes me feel better," you're doing therapy, not politics. Therapy is fine! But don't confuse it with effective advocacy.

### Rule #2: Coalitions Beat Cliques

If you're purging allies because they're imperfect, you're doing the enemy's job for them.

Yes, coalitions are messy. Yes, you'll have to work with people who are wrong about some things. Yes, it's less aesthetically pure than your tight-knit group of the ideologically correct. But coalitions are how you actually accumulate enough power to change things.

The Judean People's Front lost because they cared more about ideological purity than about beating Rome. Don't be the Judean People's Front.

### Rule #3: Harm Reduction Is Still a Win

Voting for the "lesser evil" is not glamorous. It doesn't feel revolutionary. It won't get you clout on social media. But for vulnerable groups, it can be the thin line between bad and catastrophic.

Harm reduction isn't giving up on your principles—it's recognizing that reducing harm *is* a principle. The people who will suffer most under the worse outcome don't care whether you felt good about your vote. They care whether they're safe.

### Rule #4: Process Without Teeth Is Theater

If your standard, policy, or demand doesn't change incentives or enforcement, it's probably just a press release with footnotes.

The W3C can write all the privacy specs it wants, but until there's enforcement—legal penalties, browser defaults, user revolt, something—companies will ignore them. Process is only useful if it leads to power. Otherwise, it's just busywork that makes you feel productive.

### Rule #5: Take the Boring Wins

Real progress often looks like incremental, compromise-laden steps—exactly the kind of thing purists love to dunk on.

A half-measure that actually gets implemented beats a perfect solution that stays on paper. A flawed ally who helps you win beats a perfect ally who doesn't exist. A boring policy change that shifts incentives beats a revolutionary manifesto that nobody reads.

The boring wins don't get you glory. They don't make for good social media content. They don't feel like you're changing the world. But they *actually change things*, which is supposed to be the point.

## Conclusion: Stop Performing, Start Winning

Here's the bottom line: **Cosplaying down the road to Hell** is what happens when activism, policy, and standards work care more about the *aesthetics of righteousness* than about altering material reality.

It's the Judean People's Front fighting each other instead of Rome. It's activists so focused on punishing imperfect allies that they accidentally empower open enemies. It's standards bodies writing beautiful documents that change nothing because they have no enforcement mechanism.

The common thread? Mistaking performance for power. Confusing how things look and feel with what they actually accomplish.

If you actually want better outcomes—whether for oppressed groups, for privacy, for the planet, for whatever cause you care about—you have to be willing to trade some purity and performance for strategy, coalition-building, and messy compromise.

You have to ask hard questions: Does this action shift power? Does it change incentives? Does it reduce harm? Does it build toward something bigger? Or does it just make me feel good?

Because the road to hell isn't just paved with good intentions. It's paved with people who thought their moral purity was more important than winning. It's paved with activists who preferred the aesthetics of resistance to the boring work of building power. It's paved with committees that wrote perfect standards nobody followed.

Stop cosplaying. Start counting power. Build coalitions. Take the boring wins. Reduce harm.

Or keep performing righteousness while the world burns. Your choice.

But don't act surprised when your principles lead to outcomes you hate. That's not irony—that's just what happens when you confuse looking good with doing good.
