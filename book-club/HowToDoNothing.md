Its relevance to tech culture and how to resist it, and the implications for open source, popped out for me. For example, she talks about the failure or co-optation of various "retreat from civilization" initiatives starting with Epicurus, and how the temporarily successful ones tended to have something like Plato's philosopher-kings ... (which got re-invented in OSS as BDFLs).  And the concluding chapter about Manifest Dismantling (of destructive technological infrastructure such as dams that destroy migrating fish populations) illustrates how real change comes from understanding ecosystems and giving evolution informed assistance, not just good intentions and dynamite.

The book discusses "monoculture", which of course is particularly relevant to the standardized web platform that is increasingly dominated by one open source project controlled by a huge corporation .

>  Facebook and Twitter catch and kill sustained attention by eliminating context. Social media, she writes, casts users into a void composed solely of the present, where our focus is redirected so often that, perversely, it becomes one of the only places — sometimes the only one — where we can focus at all anymore. But that place lacks context and humanity and, therefore, sustainable meaning.
> >  She sees a need for a kind of Diogenes solution: Be engaged but apart. We must be able “to contemplate and participate, to leave and always come back, where we are needed,” she writes. She calls this standing apart. “To stand apart,” she observes, “is to take the view of the outsider without leaving . . . It means not fleeing your enemy, but knowing your enemy, which turns out not to be the world — contemptus mundi — but the channels through which you encounter it day to day.”
> By standing apart, one may be able to refocus attention on the world, mitigate its social divisions and inequality, hear and see it in all its strangeness and richness. Doing nothing really means doing something: living in accordance with nature, community and careful observation of the world. “When we pry open the cracks in the concrete,” Odell writes, “we stand to encounter life itself — nothing less and nothing more.”
