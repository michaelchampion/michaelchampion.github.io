# Why are some web experts objecting to a proposed Decentralized Identifiers W3C Recommendation?

Disclaimer:  I am retired, not employed by anyone, and not a technical expert on the identity technologies.  I did represent a series of companies in W3C working groups and the 
Advisory Committee from 1997 to 2020, including Microsoft from 2004 until my retirement in 2020. I was an elected member of the W3C Advisory Board from 2010 to 2019, 
and continue some engagement with what amounts to "emeritus" status due to my service on the AB. I keep in touch with my former counterparts at Mozilla, Apple, Google,
and other W3C members, but have no access to confidential information and absolutely do not speak for them or represent them in any way.

## What does it mean for something to be a "W3C Recommendation"?

## Why do some believe the DID Data Model specification doesn't exhibit "practical (?) interoperability"? 

## sustainability

## role of W3C in the web's evolution

## Who decides how to resolve the objections?


## What is the best way forward?

I believe the W3C "Director", whoever/whatever assumes that role in this dispute, should uphold the Formal Objections and inform the [??] they need to do more work 
to justify getting Recommendation status. That is not likely to make the DID proponents happy, and they have a number of options, including:

1. Accepting the "Director's" guidance, and negotiate a clear set of criteria  that a future Proposed Recommendation could meet to presuumptively overcome these objections.

Part of the problem here is the "values" discussion ... engage to get clarity....

2. Move the work to a different standards organization that doesn't have such a strong consensus requirement.

3.
